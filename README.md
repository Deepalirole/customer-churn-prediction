ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

This Power BI dashboard project helps visualize and analyze customer churn data. It offers insights into why customers are leaving, their contracts, internet service type, tenure, and how you can reduce churn using actionable metrics. The dashboard also includes a "What-If Analysis" ROI Sandbox to simulate savings from targeted retention strategies.

ðŸ“Š Step-by-Step Implementation

Data Collection

Imported customer churn dataset (can be a .csv or Excel file).

Cleaned null values and inconsistencies using Power Query Editor.

Data Transformation

Created calculated columns like Tenure Group, Churn Clean, etc.

Created measures using DAX (e.g., churn rate %, total charges, tickets per 100 customers).

Data Modeling

Defined relationships between tables (if applicable).

Created necessary hierarchies and dimensions.
